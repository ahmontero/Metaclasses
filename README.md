Advanced Python through Django: Metaclasses
===========================================

This is the code for my talk at [Djangocon Europe](http://djangocircus.com/talks/#20).

This code is designed to be run with a tool called [prescons](https://github.com/inglesp/prescons).

To run the code:

    $ git clone git@github.com:inglesp/Metaclasses.git
    $ cd Metaclasses
    $ mkvirtualenv metaclasses
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python -m prescons djangocon.py
